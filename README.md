# Friendly

## Project outline
**Friendly** is a personal project to create an application that lets friends create groups to communicate plans. 

In these groups, they can discuss events they want to go to, sign up their names to these happenings, such that their friends can see where they are going, and buy tickets together to simplify this.

The project will have the following features:
- Create Groups in which users can discuss their plans
- Show events and which friends will go there
- If possible, integrate ticket sales, such that friends can sign up and, if all friends signed up, the tickets will be bought automatically

## Code Stack
Friendly is designed to be a full stack deployable application.

The app uses:
- **TypeScript** and **React** for the frontend
- **Go** (Gin) for the backend
- **SQLite** as database

## Code organisation
All code is strictly found in the [code](friendly/code) directory.

Backend code will be written in the [code/backend](friendly/code/backend) folder, frontend code in the [code/frontend](friendly/code/frontend) folder and the database will be situated in the [code/databade](friendly/code/database) folder.
